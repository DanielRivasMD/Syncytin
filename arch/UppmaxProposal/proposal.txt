Title

Broad-scale mobile elements genomics

Abstract

Mobile elements constitute a driving force in the evolution of species. Such elements integrate a heterogeneous group whose common feature is the ability to self-replicate. In this project, we perform a broad-scale identification for mobile elements to better understand their influence in the genomic landscape of the host.

Resource Usage

The primary type of data will be genome assemblies as well as associated files. These files will be obtained and transfer to this project from NCBI.

Data Management Plan

Data types: genomes, fastq files, binary files.
Data flow: analysis output data will be stored in flat files and postgresql data base.
This is not sensitive data.
