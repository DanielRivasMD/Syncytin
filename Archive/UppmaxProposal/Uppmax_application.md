### How to apply for Uppmax project

The [Uppmax](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/support/getting-started/) website contains a guide for project and account application.

Since what I estimate we need is only a **computing project** for now, you can check it out directly [here](https://www.uppmax.uu.se/support/getting-started/applying-for-compute/).

The requirements, according to the website, are as follows:

1. Computational requirements.
2. Login into SUPR account. The [SNIC SUPR](https://supr.snic.se/) website provides an interphase to administer your projects.
3. Project round. The one we would choose is small.
4. Create a new proposal:
	1. Project Title.
	2. Basic information: _Abstract_, _Resource Usage_.
	3. Add co-investigators. Manfred and myself, for example.
	4. Select project administrator. I can take care of this.
	5. Does not apply. We would like small project.
	6. Submit.
